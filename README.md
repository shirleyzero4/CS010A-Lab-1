Week 1 Lab: Introduction

1) Input and Formatted Output: Right Facing Arrow

Given two input integers for an arrow body and arrowhead (respectively), print a right-facing arrow.

Ex: If the input is 0 1, the output is:

         1
	0000011
	00000111
	0000011
	     1
   

2) Caffeine Levels

A half-life is the amount of time it takes for a substance or entity to fall to half its original value. Caffeine has a half-life of about 6 hours in humans. Given caffeine amount (in mg) as input, output the caffeine level after 6, 12, and 18 hours.

Ex: If the input is 100, the output is:

    After 6 hours: 50 mg
	After 12 hours: 25 mg
	After 18 hours: 12.5 mg

Note: A cup of coffee has about 100 mg. A soda has about 40 mg. An "energy" drink (a misnomer) has between 100 mg and 200 mg.
